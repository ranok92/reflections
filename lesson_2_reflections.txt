What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a reporsitory i guess u can use all the features of a 
GIT repository which is useful when it comes to revising your codes and finding bugs

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The git staging area is different from the working directory because the staging area 
is just a place the git has made which enables the user to make custom commits on the 
files he needs to commit and not the entire working directory. It offers flexibility to the 
programmer who is using git by enabling him to choose to commit on only those files that
he had made any significant changes or he wishes to.
